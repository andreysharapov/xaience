## [XAIence](https://www.xaience.eu/) is all about explainable AI, algorithmic fairness and more.
Explainable AI or XAI is one of the latest trends in the realm of AI that is trying to make opaque decision making of black-box systems more transparent. XAIence is a small consulting company that I founded to help businesses adopt XAI. XAIence or science about XAI is an effort to spread the awareness about XAI, algorithmic bias, ML secirity and more to those who are just starting to learn about it but also to those who are already proficient with some of the techniques.

The respository contains papers abour XAI, algorithmic fairness, ML security, links to source code (located in files named code in most of the folders), recent reports about ethical AI as well as links to 95% of posts in the [Explainable AI-XAI](https://www.linkedin.com/groups/8672810/) group on LinkedIn. There also papers about quantum ML and some random papers. 

This repo will be updated regularly with the most recent developments in the above-mentioned areas.
